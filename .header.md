# IllumiDesk Backoffice Resources

> **NOTE**: This module is still in DRAFT mode. It is not ready for production use. There is a known issue with the `aws_workspaces_directory` resource that prevents the module from deploying successfully.

Deploys an AWS Directory Service directory, a WorkSpaces directory, and a WorkSpace.

## Note

The AWS WorkSpaces service requires an IAM role named `workspaces_IllumiDeskRole`. If this role is already created, comment out the resources `aws_iam_role.workspaces_IllumiDeskRole` and `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.workspaces_IllumiDeskRole` in the Terraform source file [iam.tf](./iam.tf).

## Usage

### Create Terraform Variables

Copy the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars` and update the values as needed.

```shell
cp example.tfvars terraform.tfvars
```

### Terraform State

The bucket to manage state for the Workspaces is different from other IllumiDesk resources. To create the AWS S3 bucket to manage state, run the following commands:

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan -target=module.state
terraform apply -target=module.state
```

By default, resources are created in the `us-east-1` region. To override the region, set the variable `aws_region` to a different value in the `terraform.tfvars` file.

### Deploy Workspaces

Create the Workspaces resources:

```shell
terraform plan -target=module.workspaces
terraform apply -target=module.workspaces
```
